                    LIVE AT SMITH 25”.
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Cd. Juárez, Mexico - Jesus Fuentes, DMA candidate at the
                    University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is releasing his
                    debut recording “Liminality: Live at Smith 25” on all
                    digital platforms on January 22nd, 2021. This album is a
                    testament to Jazz musicians’ desire to create and express
                    themselves during times of a Global Pandemic. “So many of my
                    favorite Jazz recordings happened live in concert: My Funny
                    Valentine (Miles Davis), Benny Green Trio Live at the
                    Village Vanguard or Bill Evans Sunday at the Village
                    Vanguard are examples of records that have had a deep impact
                    on me. These live concerts are full of magical moments
                    fueled by spontaneity and interaction that were luckily
                    recorded for posterity. The first recital for my doctoral
                    degree was approaching and I was thinking to myself how I
                    have never recorded any of my concerts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I bought a portable recorder and a bunch of microphones a
                    week before the actual performance just because I wanted to
                    keep these memories of a milestone in my academic career and
                    I would be able to listen to myself playing with great
                    friends and peers. Fortunately for me, the mic placement
                    worked out very well, and even more incredible, a portable
                    recorder that I was using to record the saxophone ran out of
                    memory literally after the last note Matt played that night.
                    To me, it was a sign I had to release this.” The performance
                    took place Friday, November 13th, 2020 at Smith Memorial
                    Hall’s Room 25 – a multipurpose classroom/hall with a
                    brand-new concert Steinway.

                    The room that would’ve been filled with students, teachers,
                    family, and friends, was empty; neon pink tape over the
                    seats and on the floor, marking the spot for student
                    musicians to be distantly safe while performing, and signs
                    reminding them to wear masks and wipe down the equipment
                    with alcohol wipes. The performance was live-streamed to
                    about 80 participants that tuned in from 6 different
                    countries. This short album contains the first and only
                    takes of these tunes played from beginning to end.
                    Hopefully, it evokes the spirit of Jazz musicians. A
